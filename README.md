# TypeScript-Getting-Started

This is the official repository for my Pluralsight course titled [*TypeScript: Getting Started*](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/typescript-getting-started/table-of-contents). 
The *main* branch contains code as it 
exists at the start of the course. There are separate branches named after the modules in the course that contain the code as it 
exists at the end of that module.

I will update this repo below with any problems or small issues reported between updates to the actual course.

Thanks for watching and good luck on your TypeScript projects!


// NOTES // 

TYPESCRIPT PROJECT FILES 

- Simple Json text file names tsconfig.json
- Stores compiler options used with the project
- specifies the files thats should be included or excluded in compilation 
- Support configuration inheriteance - In a large project you can create a project file at the root of ur project that includes all of the default options you want to apply to the project. You can then create additional project files in difference folders inside the project that can selectively override or add to the option specified in the root projectf file
